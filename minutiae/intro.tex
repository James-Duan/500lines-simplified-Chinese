\begin{aosachapter}{Introduction}{s:intro}{Michael DiBernardo}

It's commonplace to say that
computer hardware is now so fast
that most developers don't have to worry about performance. 
In fact,
Douglas Crockford declined to write a chapter for this book for that reason:

\begin{quote}
If I were to write a chapter, it would be about anti-performance:
most effort spent in pursuit of performance is wasted.
I don't think that is what you are looking for.
\end{quote}

\noindent
Donald Knuth made the same point thirty years ago:

\begin{quote}
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97\% of the time:
premature optimization is the root of all evil.
\end{quote}

\noindent
but between mobile devices with limited power and memory,
and data analysis projects that need to process terabytes,
a growing number of developers \emph{do} need to make their code faster,
their data structures smaller,
and their response times shorter.
However,
while hundreds of textbooks explain the basics of operating systems,
networks,
computer graphics,
and databases,
few (if any) explain how to find and fix things
in real applications
that are simply too damn slow.

This collection of case studies is our attempt to fill that gap.
Each chapter is written by real developers
who have had to make an existing system faster
or who had to design something to be fast in the first place.
They cover many different kinds of software and performance goals;
what they have in common is a detailed understanding of what actually happens when,
and how the different parts of large applications fit together.
Our hope is that this book will---like its predecessor \emph{The Architecture of Open Source Applications}---help
you become a better developer
by letting you look over these experts' shoulders.

\emph{Daniel Rocco (Contingent)}: Daniel loves Python, coffee, craft, stout, object and system design, bourbon, teaching, trees, and Latin guitar. Thrilled that he gets to write Python for a living, he is always on the lookout for opportunities to learn from others in the community, and to contribute by sharing knowledge. He is a frequent speaker at PyAtl on introductory topics, testing, design, and shiny things; he loves seeing the spark of wonder and delight in people's eyes when someone shares a novel, surprising, or beautiful idea. Daniel lives in Atlanta with a microbiologist and four aspiring rocketeers.

He works at Dropbox, has taught Python programming courses for corporate clients, consulted on projects like the New England Wildflower Society's ``Go Botany'' Django site, and will be the chair of the PyCon conference in 2016 and 2017. Brandon believes that well-written code is a form of literature, that beautifully formatted code is a work of graphic design, and that correct code is one of the most transparent forms of thought.

\emph{Taavi Burns (DBDB)}: As the newest bass (and sometimes tenor) in Countermeasure, Taavi strives to break the mould\ldots sometimes just by ignoring its existence. This is certainly true through the diversity of workplaces in his career: IBM (doing C and Perl), FreshBooks (all the things), Points.com (doing Python), and now at PagerDuty (doing Scala).  Aside from that—when not gliding along on his Brompton folding bike—you might find him playing Minecraft with his son or engaging in parkour (or rock climbing, or other adventures) with his wife. He knits continental.
